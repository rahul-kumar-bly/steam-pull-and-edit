# About

Steam Pull and Edit uses steam API to fetch video game data by given steam app ID. Steam doesn't provide sophisticated API to work upon, however, we can still fetch data by adding parameters to URL.
This project utilizes following libraries and APIs:

- React for frontend
- Express for backend
- Cloudinary to host images
- Material UI for admin frotend
- Chakra UI for client frontend
- Swiper slider
